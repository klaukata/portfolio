    <h1 class="mt-3 mb-2 fw-bold">Rock Paper Scissors Game</h1>
    <p>The classical 2-payer game where each player chooses either rock, paper 
        or scissors and reveals their choices simultaneously. But this time 
        it's you vs. the code!</p>

        <h2 class="subpage-sections-h2 fw-bold">purpose and goal</h2>
        <p>I wanted to get familiar with <span class="red">DOM</span>, 
            and I decided to achieve that by building many projects.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="subpage-section">
        <h2 class="subpage-sections-h2 fw-bold">general requirements</h2>
        <p>As always, apart from the bare minimum that the generated website 
            must be responsive. I had a few <span class="violet">requirements</span> 
            in mind to be able to call this project a success:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The resulting website must match the design on a Figma file, that I created for it</li>
            <li>Add an animation that makes an image of what user/computer chose bigger</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    


    <div class="subpage-section">
        <h2 class="subpage-sections-h2 fw-bold">challenges</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Surprisingly, for me, I had some issues with <span class="yellow">scopes of variables</span>. 
                Variables that were defined outside of the function were not 
                'found' by my code editor, so at my first attempt, I nested all 
                of my code inside of the one function. After I decided to rewrite 
                my code this problem never surfaced again, so I am not completely 
                sure what I did wrong the first time. However, I suspect that I must 
                have simply misspelled variable names.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="subpage-section">
        <h2 class="subpage-sections-h2 fw-bold">wrapping up</h2>
        <p>I learned CSS Grid (for the second time), got to practice 
            DOM manipulation and learned how to make elements undraggable.</p>
        <p>Overall, this assignment was super fun. As always, looking back 
            at my projects, I tend to forget how many headaches each of them had caused me.</p>
        <p>Now, on to the next one.</p>
