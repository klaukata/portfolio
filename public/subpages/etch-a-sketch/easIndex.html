        <h2 class="subpage-sections-h2 fw-bold">purpose and goal</h2>
        <p>The goal was to create a basic "sketchbook" that operates 
            like a mouse-controlled Etch-a-Sketch: hovering over and pressing 
            a square would color it with a random or fixed color. Changing 
            the size of given squares would reset any previous modifications.</p>
        <p>This project is a slightly altered version of 
            <a class='violet' href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch" target="_blank"> 
            The Odin Project's assignment</a>, where the final result would 
            be a bit less complex since it required just a hover effect present.</p>

        <ol>
            <li class="fw-bold">Squares are overflowing</li>
                <p>Originally, I assumed that I will tackle the squares' layout 
                     using Flexbox. After lots of maneuvering this is the best I could achieve:</p>
                <img src="img/challanges/challange-overflow.png" alt="picture of quares overflowing">
                <p class="">At this point, I knew that <span class="yellow">re-learning Grid</span>, 
                    after years of not using it, will do the trick. And I was right.</p>
                <img src="img/challanges/challange-overflow-after.png" alt="">
            <li class="fw-bold">Squares have a fixed size</li>
                <p>At first, I defined each square's width and height by px x px. 
                    After I applied the Grid layout, I started wondering how to 
                    prevent having to set a different px value for every size. 
                    I switched to already known relative units: vh/vw, em, rem, %. 
                    To no avail. </p>
                <p>A solution to this problem came instantaneously after 
                    learning CSS Grid's <span class="yellow">fr unit</span>.</p>
            <li class="fw-bold">Two event listeners added to the same element</li>
                <p>Since I wanted squares to change color during mouse press and 
                    hover simultaneously, I thought I could nest one event listener 
                    inside another. Well, turns out you can't. 
                    <span class="gray">At least I couldn't make it work.</span></p>
                <p>I needed to find a way to omit one of the listeners, so I declared 
                    mousePosition variable:</p>
                <img style="max-width: 80%" src="img/challanges/challange-mousePosition.png" alt="">
                <p>And used in an if statement inside of the 'mouseover' event lister:</p>
                <img src="img/challanges/challange-mousePosition-nested.png" alt="">
            <li class="fw-bold">'Not allowed' cursor</li>
                <img style="max-width: 100%" src="img/challanges/challange-cursor-gif.gif" alt="">
                <p>Since I started working on this application, I encountered 
                    this random cursor change while coloring squares. At first, 
                    I assumed that it was my mouse (that had been dropped countless times) 
                    just acting up, so I simply ignored it. When I was finishing this project, 
                    however, and my to-do list got smaller and smaller, I started 
                    thinking that maybe it was not my mouse's fault at all.</p>
                <p><a class="green underline" href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_cursor.asp">W3Schools</a> 
                    explains that a not allowed cursor implies that "The cursor 
                    indicates that the requested action will not be executed". 
                    So I started thinking: What action does the browser think I 
                    want to do here? I had no idea, angry and frustrated, 
                    I abandoned the whole project until I dragged the Google logo 
                    on my homepage a few days later. And that was when it hit me: 
                    <span class="darkGreen">the browser did not allow me to drag squares</span>! 
                    Of course! </p>
                <p>So I made each hovered-over square <span class="yellow">undraggable</span>, 
                    with this line of code:</p>
                <img src="img/challanges/challange-cursor.png" alt="">
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="subpage-section">
        <h2 class="subpage-sections-h2 fw-bold">wrapping up</h2>
        <p>I learned CSS Grid (for the second time), got to practice 
            DOM manipulation and learned how to make elements undraggable.</p>
        <p>Overall, this assignment was super fun. As always, looking back 
            at my projects, I tend to forget how many headaches each of them had caused me.</p>
        <p>Now, on to the next one.</p>
